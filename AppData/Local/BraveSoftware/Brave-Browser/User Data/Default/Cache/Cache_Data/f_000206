]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This article on Overcoming The Sophomore Slump is part of the Coaching Collective series, featuring tips and expertise from Flatiron School Career Coaches. Every Flatiron School graduate is eligible to receive up to 180 days of 1:1 </em><a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-services/"><em>career coaching</em></a><em> with one of our professional coaches. This series is a glimpse of the expertise you can access during career coaching at Flatiron School.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Traditionally, the “sophomore slump” is a (completely natural) phenomenon in the learning timeline where you experience some initial success followed by reduced effort for a period of time. This reduced effort shows as a slight regression towards your goal or against the mean. There are a number of factors that contribute to the sophomore slump, and just as many ways to overcome the internal battle for motivation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Causes The Sophomore Slump?</h2>



<p>In its totality, the sophomore slump often looks like burnout from a program or a process. Being overwhelmed can often lead to apathy in your work, making it more difficult to complete or even feel invested in tasks. A 2017 <a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/educ_ifce_etds/65/">study by The University of New Mexico showed</a> that, after an initial effort, it’s natural to want ease and comfort in your next steps. But when this is applied to a learning process, it can often snowball into habits that do not serve the greater purpose of why you started in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Signs You May Be Experiencing Sophomore Slump</h2>



<p>Of course, in a bootcamp “sophomore” does not always refer to your second phase. It can be after a few weeks, or months depending on the levels of burnout you’re experiencing, or even after the initial push and excitement has worn off. Learning isn’t linear, and motivation certainly isn’t either. It can be hard to tell if you’re fatigued from all the Zoom-ing, or if there’s something a bit more patterned happening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some habits and behaviors that may indicate this pattern:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>skipping or being late to classes</li>



<li>zoning out or not paying attention</li>



<li>waiting until the last minute to start or finish assignments&nbsp;</li>



<li>feeling overwhelmed by your work&nbsp;</li>



<li>procrastinating or deprioritizing your program</li>



<li>“giving up” on assignments or concepts</li>



<li>feeling disconnected from your cohort or instructor</li>
</ul>



<p>If you happen to notice one or two of these behaviors in your own life, there’s no need to panic. As stated earlier, this is completely understandable and I’d caution to say a “normal” part of the learning process. Learning has more than one “curve”, so the most helpful steps you can take to alleviate falling behind in this manner is to first, acknowledge that you’re dealing with one of these dips in the curve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this “sophomore” point, midway through your program, things may seem most difficult or disconnected from each other. This is also the point that usually comes right before the big “aha” or “putting it all together” phase of programmatic learning. The most important thing you can do is to see it through. There are ways of getting out of thinking it is too difficult to succeed, or that you’ve fallen too far behind, or that you’re not motivated enough to finish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Overcome The Sophomore Slump</h2>



<p>Thankfully, there are methods for becoming motivated and catching up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seek Support</h3>



<p>The first step is to always reach out to your instructor, advisor and peers. It can take others checking in, or accountability meetings to get back on track. There is no shame or stigma in experiencing some setbacks in your journey. Sustaining motivation for prolonged periods of time in a goal-setting environment is <em>never</em> easy. Meeting with your instructor and advisor can give you the small, achievable, and measurable goals that you can attain to get the ball rolling again. These accountability meetings or check-ins can help you regain some self-efficacy and remind yourself that you are capable of completing difficult tasks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Look Ahead</h3>



<p>Another way to become re-engaged with your program is to look into career paths that flow from your program. <a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-services/">Career Services</a> has a myriad of resources available that can re-energize your efforts. Scroll through LinkedIn to see what projects are going on in your field that you can get excited about. Or, start looking at companies that share your passion and imagine what&#8217;s possible once you graduate.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Community Involvement</h3>



<p>Try getting involved with your community! We have some amazing people working hard to make sure you have a community of learners to help you out and engage with when you’re feeling a little behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discord can connect you with other students who are going through the same academic challenges you are. Try setting up a time to run through some code together, study, or pair up on a lab! This can be an incredibly validating experience. You&#8217;ll also review or learn new information in a different capacity, which can make it easier to remember.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are on campus, there are many opportunities to engage with others who share interests. Reach out to your campus coordinator or check out the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=flatironschool.com_n5h0flsd8f4ie573mfv6m85rn0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York">Community Calendar</a> to see what’s going on near you! There are even Career Services AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions that can be helpful and motivating.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Take A Bird&#8217;s Eye View</h3>



<p>Think in the big picture. Why are you here? What motivated you to come to Flatiron in the first place? How will your life change once you have this graduation under your belt? Everyone comes to the table with a different perspective and set of learning skills and strengths. Make sure you hold onto yours and rediscover it if you need to. There will be times when you lose motivation, that is unavoidable. But, by taking small achievable steps, you can gain back the intrinsic drive you had to finish what you started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Battling exhaustion and apathy comes with so many major learning moments in life. Remember that you can do difficult things to unlock better opportunities for the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Choosing to change careers is a big decision. Acquiring skills, building a network, and landing a job, it’s hard work! That’s why &#8211; when you’re ready to make the leap &#8211; Flatiron School is here to support you in all stages of your journey.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering whether a Flatiron School bootcamp is the right choice for you to pursue your career change dreams, take a look at some of the common FAQs below. If you like what you see, we’ll be here when you’re ready to get started.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the difference between the On-campus and online Live and online Flex experience?</h2>



<p>On-campus programs are 15 weeks long and are held full-time. Students are expected to be on campus for each day of class from 9 am – 6 pm local time. The Live program is also 15 weeks, but rather than going to a campus, you’ll be logged on and learning remotely full-time. Both on-campus and Live programs monitor attendance daily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Flex program gives students up to 60 weeks to complete the curriculum and offers the most flexibility day to day. Students enrolled in Flex programs must attend at least 10 check-ins to be eligible for graduation, but are not otherwise required to attend live instructional activities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are bootcamps worth it?</h2>



<p>Bootcamps offer a lot of things. They offer an opportunity to learn the skills you need to launch a career at a relatively affordable and fast pace.</p>



<p>What’s required of you is to find the right bootcamp. Find a place that teaches in a way that fits your learning style, meets your price point and schedule, and focuses on the languages and skills that align with your career ambitions. If you do your research and find the right place for you, then attending the right bootcamp is the right choice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do bootcamps work?</h2>



<p>Employers value people who can do the job and who can learn and adapt quickly on the job. By successfully completing a bootcamp, you’re demonstrating that you can “do” as evidenced by your projects and that you can “learn” as evidenced by completing the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Flatiron School, you’ll be able to demonstrate both. You’ll learn how to learn because new technologies appear on the market every day. Our approach enables graduates to learn and apply new tools when needed. In other words, it’s not just the skills themselves that are important to hiring managers, but how you go about acquiring skills to complete a job that sets you apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many ways, bootcamps definitely do work, and there’s a lot of proof behind that statement.</p>



<p>But it’s better to first ask yourself, “What do I want to get out of attending a bootcamp?” Asking yourself what your goals and ambitions are is how you’ll know if a bootcamp would work for you.</p>



<p>Some people want to just become acquainted with the basics of a skill, which is great, but a full-time bootcamp might not be the best route if you’re looking for a basic understanding of something &#8211; whether it&#8217;s coding, data science, cybersecurity, or product design.</p>



<p>If your goal is to learn the skills you need to pursue a new career, then yes, bootcamps do work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is an online bootcamp?</h2>



<p>While they vary with each course and each school, typical online bootcamps are short-term and often rigorous training programs to help students learn the knowledge and skills they need to be eligible for an entry-level position in a related field (aka, change careers).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What experience or requirements do you need to join Flatiron School programs?</h2>



<p>We don’t require you to have prior relevant experience to apply for any of the Flatiron School programs. Our admissions requirements are being at least 18 years old, having a high school diploma, a GED or equivalent credential, having a native or highly proficient fluency in English, and completing the admissions process.</p>



<p>Before joining your cohort on Day 1, you will have to complete around 40 hours of coursework called Prep to learn the basics of your program and prepare you for success in the course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the application process like?</h2>



<p>The first step is to fill out a written application. Once submitted, you will receive prompts from the admissions team to schedule an interview and take a 15 min aptitude assessment. During the interview, a member of the admissions team will learn about your learning needs, career goals, and help you decide whether the program is the right fit for you. If you passed your assessment, we will give you the admissions decision after your interview.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does job search support look like?</h2>



<p>The Flatiron School Career Services team exists to help you find a job. You’ll receive guidance on how to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Build and Optimize your LinkedIn Profile and Resume</li>



<li>Ace your behavioral and technical interviews</li>



<li>Grow your network of tech professionals</li>



<li>Connect with Flatiron School employer partners&nbsp;</li>



<li>Negotiate your salary</li>



<li>Optimize your job search using AI</li>



<li>Track job search activity using Huntr</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll partner with a dedicated Career Coach regularly to make forward progress each week, with up to six months of one-on-one support after graduation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Am I guaranteed employment upon graduation from the program?</h2>



<p>Flatiron School does not guarantee employment upon completing any of our programs. However, our technical curriculum combined with hands-on, one-on-one career coaching support has helped launch 7,000+ grads into new careers. While launching a new career is hard work, it is absolutely possible with consistency and commitment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Understanding how to use the abstraction of parameters keeps your code sleek, making it easier to look for bugs later.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This article on the abstraction of parameters is part of the Coaching Collective series, featuring tips and expertise from Flatiron School Career Coaches. Every Flatiron School graduate is eligible to receive up to 180 days of 1:1 </em><a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-services/"><em>career coaching</em></a><em> with one of our professional coaches. This series is a glimpse of the expertise you can access during career coaching at Flatiron School.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>While programming, you may want to have the same thing happen more than once but at separate times in the code. You can copy and paste the code from the first instance, but then you have repeating code throughout your project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a practical solution, doing this adds many lines of code for you or others to parse through to find a bug should one occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help minimize code size, stick to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code.  Using functions with parameters and arguments allow you to reuse that same code over and over without adding all the lines of code each time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a parameter?</h2>



<p>A parameter is kind of like a variable that belongs to a specific function. Just like a declared function waits to be invoked or used somewhere in the code, the parameter waits to be given a value. It just sits there in the function until it is utilized and given a value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When declaring a function you must also declare the parameter that is attached to it.  To declare the parameter all you need to do is give it a name in the parentheses of the function you have declared. The syntax looks something like this in JavaScript:</p>



<p>function myExample(myParameter){</p>



<p>return myParameter</p>



<p>}</p>



<p>When giving a parameter a name you can name it anything you want to (as long as it doesn’t repeat the name of another variable or function in the same scope). However, it is helpful to others reading your code (and as a reminder to yourself) if you give the parameter a name that represents the value it is given. </p>



<p>For instance, if you have a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius, then the value you want the function to change will always be the Fahrenheit temperature. So, calling the parameter “Fahrenheit” would be ideal.</p>



<p>function convertToCelcius(fahrenheit){</p>



<p>return (fahrenheit &#8211; 32) * 5 / 9</p>



<p>}</p>



<p>In this case, the parameter called Fahrenheit will always represent the temperature to be converted to Celcius when the convertToCelcius function is invoked and given an argument.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is an argument?</h2>



<p>Functions exist in two states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first state is the declaration, or architecture of code that will happen when the function is used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second state is the invocation of the function. This is the signal that the code in the declaration of the function should go through its coded steps. The parameter exists in the declaration version of the function and the argument exists in the invocation of the function. The argument is the value that is given to the function and, thus, assigned to the parameter of the function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the previous example, the argument would be provided for that function similarly to this:</p>



<p>convertToCelcius(78)</p>



<p>This signifies to the code that the steps in the previous function example should go through its steps with the parameter (in this case called Fahrenheit) equal to 78. So, when you invoke the function like this, the code for that one time the function performs its steps is essentially the same as this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>return (78 &#8211; 32) * 5 / 9</p>



<p>Notice that the parameter was replaced by the argument that was given to the invocation of the function. That’s because the parameter is essentially a stand-in for the argument that is passed in. This is what makes the function dynamic and reusable with different values.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Are Parameters and Arguments Linked?</h2>



<p>The parameter of a function is like a container that can hold different things in it. Let’s say you have a favorite glass that you like to drink out of for every meal. On that glass, there is a label of ‘drink’. For breakfast, you have eggs and toast and your ‘drink’ glass you fill with orange juice. After breakfast, the ‘drink’ glass is empty so you can use it again for lunch (after rinsing of course). For lunch, you have a ham sandwich and fill your ‘drink’ glass with milk. Afterward, it is empty again and can be used for dinner and so on.</p>



<p>For each meal, the glass stays the same and always has the label ‘drink’. What changes is what the glass holds. If the meals represented a function, ‘drink’ would be a parameter in that function. Whatever it is filled with represents the argument for each meal (or the invocation of the meal function).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In Conclusion</h2>



<p>Using parameters and arguments in your function allows you to reuse the code in the function for different purposes. This will keep your code sleek and minimize the lines you must trace back to find bugs in the code. It also shows employers that you can develop dynamic code for use in multiple places in an application.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Career changers often struggle with the balance of Professionalism vs. Authenticity. Here's how to blend your in and out of work selves.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://flatironschool.com/blog/professionalism-vs-authenticity/">Professionalism vs. Authenticity</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This article on Professionalism vs. Authenticity</em> <em>is part of the Coaching Collective series, featuring tips and expertise from Flatiron School Career Coaches. Every Flatiron School graduate is eligible to receive up to 180 days of 1:1 </em><a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-services/"><em>career coaching</em></a><em> with one of our professional coaches. This series is a glimpse of the expertise you can access during career coaching at Flatiron School. </em></p>



<p>Most of us are familiar with the Shakespearean quote, “To be or not to be, that is the question.”  When it comes to professionalism vs. authenticity some may ask ‘Should I choose to be professional or authentic?’ Many people feel it’s an either-or situation. But it’s possible to maintain being professional in your job search and work while embracing your true self, which will ultimately lead to more significant job opportunities, job satisfaction, and success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Professionalism vs. Authenticity: Why Is It Important?</h2>



<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines being professional as “exhibiting a courteous, conscientious and generally business-like manner in your workplace.” Or to put it another way, being a professional means carrying yourself with courtesy, care, and business savvy. It&#8217;s about being considerate to others, showing diligence in your actions, and handling things with a touch of class.</p>



<p>Being professional builds credibility and trust among colleagues and clients, positioning you as a reliable person. By showcasing courteous and business-like behavior, you develop strong and meaningful relationships, which opens the way for successful networking, job opportunities, collaborations, and career growth. Moreover, maintaining a positive personal brand through professionalism sets you apart from the crowd, opening doors to opportunities and leaving a lasting impression on others.</p>



<p>At this point you may be thinking, I get it, it’s essential to be professional so I’ll “fake it” during the interview and carry that into my daily work. “Faking it” is tiring, being yourself is exhilarating. Own who you are in the interview process and carry that freedom to be yourself over into your work life (within reason, of course).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Blend Authenticity With Professionalism</h2>



<p>It starts with knowing your values, strength, abilities, and personal brand.</p>



<p>Blending your true self with professionalism involves aligning your values, strengths, and abilities with the standards of your workplace, and finding a balance that reflects your authentic character. Embrace your unique personal brand as an asset, and show it confidently while adapting it to complement the professional environment, which will lead to your creating a powerful and genuine impression on others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adapt Your Communication Style</h3>



<p>This involves tailoring your approach to resonate with different audiences, keeping in mind their preferences and needs. At the same time, add your unique personality, values, and perspectives into your interactions, creating an authentic and memorable impression that fosters real connections.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dress With Style</h3>



<p>Dressing to reflect your style involves selecting attire that fits your job search and workplace norms and expectations while adding subtle touches that showcase who you are. By blending professional clothing with elements that resonate with your unique taste, you show your confidence and authenticity, making a powerful statement that sets you apart stylishly and professionally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Customize Branding Documents </h3>



<p>Add your style to your <a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-services/">personal branding documents</a> by incorporating design elements, colors, or fonts that resonate with your identity. By doing so, you create a cohesive and authentic representation of yourself, leaving a lasting impression that catches your audience’s attention and sets your work apart with a touch of individuality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Highlight Your Passions and Interests </h3>



<p>Seek opportunities that align with your values and hobbies. Embracing your passions not only increases your motivation and enthusiasm but also allows you to bring unique perspectives and creativity to your professional opportunities, making your career journey fulfilling and rewarding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Express Opinions Respectfully</h3>



<p>Actively listen to others, consider their viewpoints, and communicate with empathy and open-mindedness. If you choose your words thoughtfully and focus on having a collaborative atmosphere, you create space for conversations that encourage understanding and healthy relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Professionalism + Self-Expression = Success</h2>



<p>Finding the right balance between professionalism vs. authenticity is the key to unlocking a world of possibilities in your job search and workplace. Embracing your true self while upholding professional standards allows you to build credibility, trust, and meaningful relationships, leading to greater job opportunities, job satisfaction, and overall success. By being true to yourself and showcasing your unique qualities, you not only stand out from the crowd but also create a fulfilling and rewarding career journey that aligns with your passions and interests. So, let your authenticity shine as you navigate the professional landscape, and watch as your genuine approach moves you toward achievement and personal growth.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>When Jon Brundage Jr. took time during the pandemic to reevaluate his career choices, he decided it was time to make a change.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrundagejr/">Jon Brundage Jr.</a>, a June 2021 Software Engineering graduate from Flatiron School, rethought his initial career choice during the COVID pandemic.</p>



<p>He shares his journey from TV Production to Software Engineering below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pre-Pandemic Career Path</h2>



<p>Jon Brundage Jr. began his career with a degree in Media Studies and spent more than a decade in the field. But, like many others in the media, the 2020 pandemic threw a wrench in his plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I came from a twelve-year career in freelance television production working as a director of photography and camera operator,” Jon said when we interviewed him earlier this year. “When the pandemic hit, I had a lot of downtime to reassess what I was contributing to the world.”</p>



<p>While the world stood still, Jon used his time to take a tally of his current occupation. Through that contemplation, he came to the conclusion that it was time to pivot paths.</p>



<p>“[TV] Production is fun, but it is very physically demanding and requires a lot of time on the road. My wife was also pregnant with our son, and I knew I did not want to be a parent who was always away,” he explained. “So, between wanting to be more meaningful and intentional with my career and wanting more balance between life and work, I decided to make a change.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pivoting To Tech</h2>



<p>Having decided to make a switch, Jon quickly settled on Software Engineering, citing the field’s versatility and demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I knew that software engineering would open a lot of doors to explore my next role,” he said.<br>“There are so many different types of companies and organizations that [need Software Engineers] and I was very attracted to the idea that my skills could be transferable to a wide swath of industries and employers.”</p>



<p>But, as a husband and soon-to-be father, Jon didn’t want to take the traditional 4-year degree route. To get to his goals faster, he started looking into bootcamps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I asked some friends and family who worked in tech where I should go. Flatiron School [was mentioned by] my best friend who has been a software engineer for years, as well as my brother who is an accomplished graphic designer,” he said. “After some initial research, I knew it was the right choice for me to have a solid foundation to start a new career.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bootcamp Experience</h2>



<p>Jon enrolled in <a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/">Flatiron School’s Software Engineering Live program</a> in March 2021, an accelerated, intensive course. Students in the program study full-time &#8211; 8 hours a day, Monday to Friday &#8211; for 15 weeks. Learning new Software Engineering skills at the break-neck pace, Jon said, was difficult to adjust to at first.  </p>



<p>“The most challenging part of the program was the gear switching,” he explained. “You spend two weeks learning something new, practice and test on it for another week, and then start all over. By the third phase I was used to it, but it’s overwhelming for the first few weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What pulled Jon through the beginning difficulties of the course was the phase one instructor that helped him adapt to the material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My favorite part of the program was my phase one instructor, who completely laid the foundation for my success in the program,” he said. “[He] explained this new world of Javascript in a way that was very accessible and had so much patience for all of my questions. He took this very big, intimidating process and gave me the tools to feel empowered from day one and I will be forever grateful for all his tutorage.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Job Search</h2>



<p>Jon graduated from Flatiron School in June 2021 and jumped straight into the job search, focusing primarily on making connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I put a lot of energy into networking. I asked friends and friends of friends if they knew any Software Engineers and if they&#8217;d have time to chat over coffee or Zoom,” he recalled. “I&#8217;ve always thought face-to-face networking is the biggest bang for your buck in job hunting, to this day.”</p>



<p>His original perception of Software Engineering being an in-demand skillset ultimately turned out to be true when a recruiter reached out to him with an opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was extremely lucky in my job hunt. My current company actually found me and, after a few interviews, they brought me on as a part-time contractor. After a few months, I became full-time staff.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working In The Field </h2>



<p>When we spoke with Jon in June 2023, he’d been working as a Creative Technologist at Schema Design for just under two years. His experience working in the field, he said, has been overwhelmingly positive. </p>



<p>“I am thoroughly enjoying my new career. I work for a design firm and my role is fairly client-facing, which has a good amount of overlap of soft skills from my previous career,” he said. “My projects and stacks change every few weeks or months, so I&#8217;ve gotten my hands on a ton of technologies in the last year and a half. I&#8217;m learning new skills every day and constantly asking myself <em>&#8216;How can I do this better?&#8217;</em>.”</p>



<p>His position has also allowed him to expand his development skillset &#8211; building on the foundation he developed while at Flatiron School.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My company specializes in data visualizations so from the start of my job, I&#8217;ve learned some really cool frameworks and libraries. I&#8217;ve built sites in React, Vue, and Svelte, and some pretty cool interactive experiences with d3 and Three.js. [I rebuilt] the company website from scratch a few months back in NUXT3, which I find to be an amazing framework. It offers universal rendering so you get the flexibility of single-page applications, while also the performance and SEO of a static site. You can check it out at <a href="https://www.schemadesign.com/">SchemaDesign.com</a>.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reflecting On His Journey</h2>



<p>Looking back on where he began three years ago, Jon emphasizes the importance of believing that you can actually make a change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;My biggest takeaway from Flatiron School was that I am capable of learning new tricks. I&#8217;d been in my former career for over a decade and worried that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to adapt to a new setting,” he recalled. “It took a while to believe in myself and get over impostor syndrome, but eventually, you do eventually feel like a real Software Engineer.”</p>



<p>His advice for current and future Software Engineering students is to lean into the uncomfortable nature of change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Learn to be comfortable with not knowing. So much of software engineering is getting a problem or task you haven&#8217;t solved before and figuring out how to tackle it. Be confident in your ability to learn new skills, and know that this feeling of not knowing exactly what you&#8217;re doing means you&#8217;re on the right track. It isn&#8217;t forever and you will see tangible growth in even a few months from where you&#8217;re at right now.”</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-wolfee/">Maxwell Wolfe</a>, a May 2021 Cybersecurity graduate, says that he could easily fill the pages of a book to explain the winding career path he’s taken to get where he is today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He shares his journey to becoming a Cybersecurity business owner below, and all of the winding turns along the way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blue-Collar Background</h2>



<p>Maxwell describes his background as “diverse.” A college dropout, he remembers having difficulty in the traditional education system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My best learning occurs through doing and tinkering; I&#8217;ve never been one for memorization or traditional testing,” he said. “Grasping complex information requires a hands-on approach for me. In summary, I&#8217;m a kinesthetic learner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This educational tendency led him to hold a string of unrelated jobs that all had one thing in common &#8211; he was able to work with his hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My career trajectory has been anything but conventional. I&#8217;ve worked in kitchens, bars, construction, and even nightclubs as a DJ and tech support.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In early 2020, Maxwell was working in nightclubs in the DC area as tech support and an opening DJ for headliners. But, due to his eclectic collection of hands-on job experiences, the declaration of the pandemic struck a death blow to his occupation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When COVID-19 arrived, social life came to a standstill, and work dried up. I lost everything and was forced to start anew,” he explained. “It was then that I decided to pivot towards something sustainable, never wanting to find myself in such a precarious situation again.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pivoting Into Tech</h2>



<p>In his search for a new career, Maxwell didn’t have to go far. He went back to his early curiosity in “gadgets,” renewing his interest in a tech career he’d long ago discounted as unrealistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tech and video games always intrigued me,” he recalled. “But I never thought I was cut out for a career in tech until I stumbled upon some free online resources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His decision to pursue Cybersecurity specifically, however, was driven by a more recent experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The TV show Mr. Robot was a significant catalyst, inspiring me to dive into tech and, more specifically, ethical hacking. The idea of protecting individuals or non-profit organizations sparked my desire to contribute positively to society and prompted me to embark on this new career path.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">His Bootcamp Experience</h2>



<p>Having settled on a career in Cybersecurity, Maxwell cast about looking for ways to acquire the necessary skills to enter the field &#8211; a search that eventually led him to apply to Flatiron School.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My decision to join Flatiron School was primarily based on the school&#8217;s reputation,” he recalled. “And the fact that its instructors have real-world industry experience.”</p>



<p>Maxwell enrolled in Flatiron School’s full-time Cybersecurity program, an intensive, accelerated course designed to equip students with the foundational skills needed to break into the Cybersecurity industry in just 15 weeks. He began his learning on a rigorous schedule &#8211; 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday &#8211; a time-commitment that he said took time to adjust to.</p>



<p>“Balancing this program with three other jobs was undoubtedly challenging. However, the toughest part was realizing that in tech, you&#8217;re often your own support system. The transition from an outsider to the go-to tech person can be overwhelming at first.”</p>



<p>Despite the oftentimes grueling task of balancing education and work, Maxwell thrived in the communal environment fostered by the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I appreciated the collaborative environment of the program, where we were encouraged to work in teams, brainstorm, and devise solutions for our projects.”</p>



<p>As for what brought him the most pride from his time at Flatiron School, Maxwell told us about how he used his new skills to help a friend.</p>



<p>“I managed to track down a cyberstalker for one of my friends. This experience was incredibly fulfilling and demonstrated the real-world impact of my new skills.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working In The Field</h2>



<p>Maxwell Wolfe graduated from Flatiron School in May 2021. Coming from a career of hands-on roles where a handshake landed a position, executing a purely-online search for a white-collar job (while the pandemic slowly petered out) presented some initial difficulties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The job search was challenging, but my coach was instrumental in keeping me motivated,” Maxwell recalled. “She guided me in finding job platforms, writing blogs, and understanding LinkedIn. Even now, she remains a strong pillar of support, cheering me on whenever possible. Thanks, Sarah <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, his efforts paid off, and he worked as a SOC Analyst at a technology company for over a year. When we spoke with him in July 2023, he’d taken time between contracts to earn additional certifications, enhance his skills, open his own company, and &#8211; most importantly of all &#8211; recuperate from burnout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The transition [to tech] in less than six months was undoubtedly tough. The initial stages were overwhelming, and I won&#8217;t deny that I experienced burnout,” he said. “But things are much better now, and I&#8217;ve even launched my own freelance work and registered an LLC. I also joined the HackerOne platform as an ethical hacker, hunting for bug bounties to build my experience across various legal hacker platforms.”</p>



<p>Maxwell opened <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolfhart-it/">Wolfhart IT</a>, an IT service provider and consulting firm, in mid-2023. In early July he shared on LinkedIn that his company had signed its first contract.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reflecting On His Journey</h2>



<p>Looking back on the long road he took to Cybersecurity and his time at Flatiron School, Maxwell’s main takeaway is the necessity of adopting a learner’s growth mindset &#8211; especially in a rapidly evolving field like tech.</p>



<p>“Learning never ends in the tech industry. To stay relevant, one must commit to being a lifelong learner in this ever-evolving field.”</p>



<p>His advice for current students follows the same vein &#8211; encouraging learning while maintaining healthy habits and realistic expectations of exactly how much you can take on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Before committing to a bootcamp, do extensive research. Ensure you balance your work with relaxation to avoid burnout. Don&#8217;t try to cram all the information at once.”</p>



<p>Post-Flatiron School, he has some practical career advice as well &#8211; keep learning and attaining qualifications!</p>



<p>“Consider following the CompTIA career path, and don&#8217;t limit yourself to just the Security+ certification. The A+ and Network+ certifications are also beneficial. Additionally, consider Google&#8217;s Security and Support Specialist programs for their certifications.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A modern tech team with updated skills is the key to success. While most organizations realize training is critical, it can be hard to know where to start. No matter your business’s needs or phase in the “hire to retire” tech talent life cycle, Flatiron School is ready to help and answer all your enterprise FAQs.</p>



<p>We’ve trained more than 10,000 learners over the past decade. What&#8217;s more, we&#8217;ve helped dozens of organizations save time, money, and headaches in attracting and retaining top talent.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering where &#8211; or how &#8211; to get started training your workers, take a look at some of the common FAQs about our Enterprise programs, and see if you see any overlap with your needs. If you do, we’ll be here when you’re ready to get started.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Partner with Flatiron School?</h2>



<p>Flatiron School’s programs are centered on high-quality curriculum, learning experiences, and outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While other tech educators scramble to acquire as many learners as possible—diluting themselves in the process with many different programs or by chasing the next great marketing statistic—Flatiron School is laser-focused on delivering the best education possible across four core disciplines:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/">Software Engineering</a></li>



<li><a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/data-science-bootcamp/">Data Science</a></li>



<li><a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/cybersecurity-engineering-bootcamp/">Cybersecurity</a></li>



<li><a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/product-design-bootcamp/">UX/UI Product Design</a></li>
</ul>



<p>We set and maintain the highest standards when it comes to teaching relevant skills, learner outcomes, and client satisfaction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do Flatiron School Instructors Have Industry Experience?</h2>



<p>Our instructors have hands-on experience in their respective fields. Our solutions engineers and curriculum developers have decades of combined experience and diverse backgrounds in industry, academia, and the military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, our instructors, solutions engineers, and curriculum developers keep our programs fresh by developing content that corresponds to active job descriptions—as well as seeking feedback from hiring managers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Flatiron School Prioritize Diversity?</h2>



<p>Over the past decade, we’ve trained over 10,000 diverse learners from all walks of life. We have a history of working to diversify the tech industry through scholarships for underrepresented groups, such as women, persons of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and low-income households.</p>



<p>Flatiron School also makes tremendous efforts to remove biases from the recruiting process, ensuring talent is evaluated solely on their abilities and propensity to succeed. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Do You Address Bootcamp Stereotypes?</h2>



<p>Bootcamps sometimes garner a negative reputation because they’re not overly transparent with their data. For example, competitors may say they have a 100% placement rate, but that placement rate could include grads who received unpaid internships. Flatiron School goes the extra mile to be transparent. We were the first in the tech education industry to publicly publish a <a href="https://flatironschool.com/jobs-reports/">jobs report</a>, which is reviewed for accuracy by a neutral third party.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Should We Use Flatiron School to Train Our Employees?</h2>



<p>Our core expertise is in helping organizations deeply understand tech talent and strategically invest in the “hire to retire” lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With curriculum covering a variety of languages, frameworks, and libraries across Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Data Science, and UX / UI Product Design and the flexibility to train when, where, and how you want &#8211; including with or without instructor-led training &#8211; our programs are tailored to meet your business-specific training needs.</p>



<p>To learn more about our suite of solutions including Hire &amp; Train, Onboarding, Reskilling, Upskilling, and Licensing Curriculum, visit our <a href="https://flatironschool.com/tech-training-solutions/">Training Solutions page</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Benefits Of Instructor-Led Training?</h2>



<p>When you choose an instructor-led training program, as opposed to conducting the training internally, you’re getting our instructors&#8217; expertise, experience, and accumulated knowledge base on how best to teach their material. Other tangible benefits include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ability to adapt programs to learners’ style and progress &#8211; everyone learns differently. When instructors have the flexibility to tailor programs to learning styles, existing knowledge, and progress, they typically see a higher aptitude for success.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Real-time interaction with instructors &#8211; When learners have the opportunity to ask questions and receive personalized help, it fosters accelerated learning and enhances knowledge retention.</li>



<li>Peer learning &#8211; Collaborative learning opens the door for new perspectives and an overall dynamic learning environment. It also promotes professional growth and networking opportunities.</li>



<li>Increased learner engagement &#8211; Learners with a structure such as regular assignments, group activities, and milestones stay motivated and accountable, ultimately resulting in higher engagement and success rates.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Flexible schedules &#8211; Programs have higher levels of engagement when hosted at convenient times, allowing learners to be free of any commitments and distractions.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can Employee Tech Training Benefit Us?</h2>



<p>Investing in employee training improves retention rates and keeps your employees’ skills up to date, improving your company’s agility in the marketplace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This article is part of the Coaching Collective series, featuring tips and expertise from Flatiron School Career Coaches. Every Flatiron School graduate is eligible to receive up to 180 days of 1:1 </em><a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-services/"><em>career coaching</em></a><em> with one of our professional coaches. This series is a glimpse of the expertise you can access during career coaching at Flatiron School.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It’s time to question the tried and true method of “hitting the books”. Finding out your learning style, and switching modalities up when you need to is a crucial piece of finding success as an adult learner. I know that when we were all in traditional school settings cramming until 2 AM, reading the same passages over and over, and making ornate flashcards were common paths to take for success. However, in a fast-paced setting like a bootcamp, those old study habits may no longer cut it.  If you’re struggling to get new material to really “stick”, then it’s time to try out a different style. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Learning Styles</h2>



<p>There are a lot of different “types” or “styles” of learning. At the basis of learning is how you are absorbing information. So, try this. Think about a specific happy memory you have from childhood. <em>How </em>are you remembering that point in time? <em>What </em>is standing out? Is it the dialogue, can you see it like a movie, is it something that was written down, was it who you were with or what you were physically doing? What stands out most to you is a good indicator of how you&#8217;re absorbing information, and therefore how you learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider the list below, and know that you are probably a mixture of several types, with a few more dominant than others. This is also a short list of some options, you can find more nuanced types if you dig a little deeper. The <a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">VARK</a> questionnaire can help you delineate these nuances. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Visual</h3>



<p>Visual learners absorb what they see over what they hear or read. Most people are visual learners or have a strong affinity for visual learning. These folks can find schematics, sketches and diagrams, or watch videos or create visualizations to study broader concepts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Auditory</h3>



<p>Auditory learners most effectively learn through listening. This is a language-based style, like verbal, but auditory learners best process information by listening, not just reading. Incorporating this into your studies could look like, listening to lectures multiple times, asking questions and engaging in dialogue with peers and instructors, making songs or rhymes for memorization, or finding videos of differing explanations of a concept. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kinesthetic</h3>



<p>Kinesthetic or tactile learners are individuals who need to move or use tangible objects to absorb information. If you’ve ever found yourself tapping a pencil to focus, or chewing gum during a lecture, you might have a bit of this learning style. Incorporating kinesthetic learning into your day could look like hands-on practicing of concepts to make them malleable, walking while you listen to a lecture or video, or having something in your hands while you listen or read (I recall a professor passing out Play-Doh at one point to help out these students).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Verbal</h3>



<p>Verbal learners are, like auditory learners, language-based. However, these students gravitate toward reading and speaking. Students who learn primarily verbally perform best when reading and annotating, taking notes, repeating information back, or finding other ways to summarize. Often, these students find the Canvas coursework to be helpful and will revisit during code challenges or project times to re-read and review.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social</h3>



<p>Social learners can be any and all of the above styles as well, but social learners simply learn better with others or in groups. These learners choose classroom learning and in-person so they can ask questions and create a dialogue for deeper meaning. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Solitary</h3>



<p>On the other hand, solitary learners often absorb information and content best when they are by themselves. These are folks who also tend to need a more quiet and focused space to work, often retreating to libraries or quieter corners. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sub-Types</h3>



<p>Within these types, there are many different subcategories that are worth diving into if you find that you aren’t retaining information as well as you’d like in your current program. Between the Canvas work, lectures, paired programming, labs, and even Discord, the amount of resources can be overwhelming. This is why it&#8217;s important to experiment with your learning. If you find that what you’re doing isn’t working, look for a better way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Implement Your Learning Styles</h2>



<p>Try a few things! Here are some low stakes ways to experiment with the type of learner you may be now. </p>



<ul>
<li>Switch up your reading/lecture order to see how one informs the other in your live or campus classes. </li>



<li>Find a podcast or a Youtube channel that can solidify some information that you’re just not picking up on in other settings.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Reach out on Discord to partner with someone in an additional practice lab in Canvas.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Explain a process to one of your peers, or have them explain it back to you to have that knowledge solidify.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Switch up the times of day that you independently study.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Find instructions for a visualization or build a model.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Switch your readings to audio recordings.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Reaching out to your advisor is also a great way to get some ideas about how to switch up your schedule to accommodate for these risks.</li>
</ul>



<p>At Flatiron School, we want to expand your soft skills as well as teach you those content driven skills in your program. It’s crucial that you’re flexible enough in your learning and problem solving so you can adapt to any project or role you may be in once you land that job. Get creative in your projects while you’re working with your peers, and try something new. This might mean that you speak up more during your presentations, or take charge of a different section of the project you’re traditionally uncomfortable with. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Example Of A Student Using Learning Styles</h2>



<p>An advisee recently told me that they were experiencing a mental block with how to approach a new topic for their software engineering program. They found that they were stressing out more finding “the most efficient way to approach it”, which in turn made it really…inefficient. So, they took a learning styles quiz which turned up multi-modal, giving very little reprieve on the efficiency front. After chatting about some next steps, we switched the approach to try a new study approach each day, and see what sticks. I know it sounds trivial, and really panic inducing when there’s only so much time in the program. But, once you find that new hack for your brain, you’ll be amazed at what starts to click.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good news on that friend of ours, they did incredibly well in Phase 3 of their program. And they’re still switching up their approach when they need to. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In Conclusion</h2>



<p>Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone when working with new content. Often, students will switch up their approaches in different phases as well. If you need ideas, talking to your peers, instructors, and advisors can be helpful if you find yourself reading the same passage over and over to no avail. We’ve all been there. Don’t forget: it’s not that you can’t do it, it’s that you just need to find the way in. </p>
